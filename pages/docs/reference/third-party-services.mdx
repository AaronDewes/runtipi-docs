# Third-party services

## Telemetry

By default your Tipi instance will send anonymous crash reports to [Sentry](https://sentry.io). These reports help the team to debug and resolve issues in a fast manner.
If you don't want to participate in this anonymous program you can disable the option in the settings page of the dashboard or by adding
the following option in your `settings.json` file:

```json
{
  "allowErrorMonitoring": false
}
```

Tipi does not have any user-tracking or analytics feature. It does not collect any data about you or your usage as an individual or as a group.
