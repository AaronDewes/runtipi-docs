# Using the CLI

If you are running a version above 1.6.0 the ```scripts``` folder is deprecated and no longer working and the recommended way
to interact with tipi from the command line is the all new utility ```runtipi-cli```. The cli is a powerfull tool added to tipi
that organizes everything in one file. Here is the reference:

Usage:

```bash
./runtipi-cli command options
```

## Start Command

The start command starts tipi through the command line.

To start tipi run the following command:

```bash
sudo ./runtipi-cli start
```

<Callout type="info">
The ```start``` command can also be used to restart tipi although the ```restart``` command that is referenced bellow is the 
recommended way.
</Callout>

<Callout type="info">
Tipi requires root to run in order to create some file permissions so thats why ```sudo``` is being used. If you are the root account you 
can skip the ```sudo``` command.
</Callout>

<Callout type="warning">
If you don't want to provide root access to tipi you can use the ```--no-sudo``` switch to run in a fully rootless mode. However this 
is still in development and you may face permission issues with some apps.
</Callout>

## Stop Command

The stop command stop tipi through the command line.

To stop tipi run the following command:

```bash
sudo ./runtipi-cli stop
```

## Restart Command

To restart tipi from the command line run this command:

```bash
sudo ./runtipi-cli restart
```

## Update 

This command updates tipi to the latest version available.

You can update to the latest version with this command:

```bash
sudo ./runtipi-cli update
```

If you want to specify a specific version to update or downgrade to you can use the command 
like this:

```bash
sudo ./runtipi-cli update v2.0.7
```

<Callout type="warning">
You can downgrade Tipi to a previous version by running the update command with the version you want to downgrade to.
However, this is highly discouraged as it may lead to breaking your install.
