# Using the CLI

If you are running a version above 1.6.0 the ```scripts``` folder is deprecated and no longer working and the recommended way
to interact with tipi from the command line is the all new utility ```runtipi-cli```. The cli is a powerfull tool added to tipi
that organizes everything in one file. Here is the reference:

Usage:

```bash
./runtipi-cli command options
```

## Start Command

The start command starts tipi through the command line.

To start tipi run the following command:

```bash
sudo ./runtipi-cli start
```

<Callout type="info">
Tipi is run as root in the examples because during the start process it needs to check and eventually change the permissions of some files in the `runtipi` folder. You can run the command without sudo but it is not guaranteed to work.
</Callout>

## Stop Command

The stop command stop tipi through the command line.

To stop tipi run the following command:

```bash
sudo ./runtipi-cli stop
```

## Restart Command

To restart tipi from the command line run this command:

```bash
sudo ./runtipi-cli restart
```

## Update 

This command updates tipi to the latest version available.

You can update to the latest version with this command:

```bash
sudo ./runtipi-cli update latest
```

If you want to specify a specific version to update or downgrade to you can use the command 
like this:

```bash
sudo ./runtipi-cli update v2.0.7
```

<Callout type="warning">
You can downgrade Tipi to a previous version by running the update command with the version you want to downgrade to.
However, this is highly discouraged as it may lead to breaking your install. Make sure you know what you are doing.
</Callout>


## Reset password command

This command is used to reset a forgotten password.

To reset your password run the following command and refresh your tipi webpage
it should prompt you to enter your new password.

```bash
./runtipi-cli reset-password
```

## Clean logs command

To clean the logs run this command:

```bash
./runtipi-cli clean-logs
```

## App management command

```
./runtipi-cli app [command] <app>
```

**Example**: Start the code-server app

```bash
./runtipi-cli app start code-server
```

**Example**: Stop the code-server app

```bash
./runtipi-cli app stop code-server
```
