# Using the CLI

The runtipi-cli is a command line tool that allows you to start, stop, restart, update, and manage tipi from the command line.

Usage:

```bash
./runtipi-cli command options
```

## Start Command

To start tipi run the following command:

```bash
sudo ./runtipi-cli start
```

<Callout type="info">
  Tipi is run as root in the examples because during the start process it needs to check and
  eventually change the permissions of some files in the `runtipi` folder. You can run the command
  without sudo if needed but you may encounter permission issues.
</Callout>

## Stop Command

To stop tipi run the following command:

```bash
sudo ./runtipi-cli stop
```

## Restart Command

To restart tipi from the command line run this command:

```bash
sudo ./runtipi-cli restart
```

## Update

This command updates tipi to the latest version available.

You can update to the latest version with this command:

```bash
sudo ./runtipi-cli update latest
```

If you want to update to a specific version you give the version number as an argument:

```bash
sudo ./runtipi-cli update v2.0.7
```

<Callout type="warning">
  You can downgrade Tipi to a previous version by running the update command with the version you
  want to downgrade to. However, this is highly discouraged as it may lead to breaking your install.
  Make sure you know what you are doing.
</Callout>

## Reset password command

This command is used to reset a forgotten admin password.

To reset your password run the following command and visit the tipi rest page at `http://<your-ip>/reset-password`
it should prompt you to enter your new password.

```bash

```

## App management command
