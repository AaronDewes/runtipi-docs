# Running the CLI locally

While the CLI is not meant to run during development, when developing new features for the CLI, it is useful to run it locally to test your changes.

You can do so by navigating to the `packages/cli` folder and executing the following command:

```bash
NODE_ENV=development npx tsx ./src/index.ts <command>
```

This will run the CLI using the TypeScript compiler and execute the `index.ts` file with the given command.
This command is the equivalent of running `./runtipi-cli <command>` on a production instance.
